/*
	In this code we will learn how do declare pointer variables
*/

#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
using namespace std;


int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	int *ptr;
	return 0;
}


	* - now what is this
	* - is this dereference? No. Then, what is it?
	* - this time it is asterisk

	I know what you are feeling now. Cause same operator has three names

	* - multipication , binary
	* - dereference , unary
	* - asterisk , unary

	it can get confusing but we have no choice but to remember them and what they do
	if we want to work with C/C++

	* - multipication , binary , for multiply two numbers (integer or float)
	* - dereference , unary , for accessing value of a address
	* - asterisk , unary , for declaring a pointer value

	Now, let's talk about how to declare pointer variables
