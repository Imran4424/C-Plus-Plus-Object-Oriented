/*
	cout is the output stream for c++

	iostream holds cin cout

	cin : for input stream
	cout : for output stream

	int main(int argc, char const *argv[]); this is for console input

	if you don't use console input you can skip these parameters

	but writing them doesn't mean that using console is mandatory

	like this program,
					I wrote them, because, I love this type of main function style

					but I am not using any console input
